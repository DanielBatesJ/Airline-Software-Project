*STILL CONTAINS BUGS*

A class project where we were tasked with creating a multi-file, modular airline system to manage flight crew, airplanes, 
and flights using object-oriented programing, inheritance and vectors.

I plan to revisit this code in the future to refine it and iron out some bugs to do with loads from files, and a few pointer issues.
Compiling on Linux should be as simple as using the makefile provided. If you need to compile on Windows I recommend finding a program 
to adapt the makefile, or to attempt to use the .exe I compiled for my Windows 10 Machine.
